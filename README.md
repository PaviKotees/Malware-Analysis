# Malware Analysis Lab
Creation of Malware Analysis Lab on local machine using Flare VM and Remnux and on cloud with AWS.

**Local Machine Malware Analysis Lab:**

To self-host a lab, the following platforms will be used:

**Oracle VirtualBox** - Detonating malware onto our main working system is not advised, hence the use of VirtualBox to create a sandbox environment.

**Flare VM** - installed on Windows 10 base machine is a collection of software installation scripts for Windows systems that allows the setup of a analysis lab and reverse engineering environment in Virtual Machine(VM).

**Remnux** - similar version of Flare VM but for Linux OS.


## Introduction

Upon passing the [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/CompTIA%20Security+%20SY0-601%20Exam%20Objectives%20(3.0).pdf), I realized that I needed hands on experience with malware and hence the establlishment of this lab.

In this page, I will be showcasing the important steps I followed to setup a Malware Analysis Lab with [FlareVM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) and Remnux. I will also be analysing various malware and list out their properties, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) etc.

**Malware Analyzed**

- Zeus Banking Trojan
- PDF Malware

## The Project

To be able to create the laboratory it is important know the working of Oracle Virtualbox since that is our base.
