# Malware Analysis Lab
Creation of Malware Analysis Lab on local machine using Flare VM and Remnux and on cloud with AWS.

**Local Machine Malware Analysis Lab:**

To self-host a lab, the following platforms will be used:

**Oracle VirtualBox** - Detonating malware onto our main working system is not advised, hence the use of VirtualBox to create a sandbox environment.

**Flare VM** - installed on Windows 10 base machine is a collection of software installation scripts for Windows systems that allows the setup of a analysis lab and reverse engineering environment in Virtual Machine(VM). This machine is where the malware will be installed and detonated.

**Remnux** - similar version of Flare VM but for Linux OS, this machine will be used as a C2 server during dynamic analysis of malware.


## Introduction

Upon passing the [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/CompTIA%20Security+%20SY0-601%20Exam%20Objectives%20(3.0).pdf), I realized that I needed hands on experience with malware and hence the establlishment of this lab.

In this page, I will be showcasing the important steps I followed to setup a Malware Analysis Lab with [FlareVM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) and Remnux. I will also be analysing various malware and list out their properties, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) etc.

**Tools used for Analysis**

- VirusTotal - Analyze files and URLs for viruses, worms, trojan and other kinds of malicious content.
- Pestudio - Used to statically analyze executlable files for malicious artifacts
- Cutter - Advanced and open-source tool for reverse engineering malware.
- Procmon - Process Monitor is used for real-time monitoring of all file system acitivity.

**Malware Analyzed**

- Zeus Banking Trojan
- PDF Malware

  **Overview of analysis**

  - Fingerprint of the malware
  - Static Analysis
  - Dynamic Analysis

## The Project

To be able to create the laboratory it is important know the working of Oracle Virtualbox since that is our base and install Windows 10 Enterprise with atleast 75GB of allocated memory.
