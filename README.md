# Introduction

**Platforms used to build self-hosted Malware Analysis Lab:**

- **Oracle VirtualBox** - Detonating malware onto our main working system is not advised, hence the use of VirtualBox to create a sandbox environment.

- **Flare VM** - installed on Windows 10 base machine is a collection of software installation scripts for Windows systems that allows the setup of a analysis lab and reverse engineering environment in Virtual Machine(VM). This machine is where the malware will be installed and detonated.

- **Remnux** - similar version of Flare VM but for Linux OS, this machine will be used as a C2 server during dynamic analysis of malware.

Upon passing the [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/CompTIA%20Security+%20SY0-601%20Exam%20Objectives%20(3.0).pdf), I realized that I needed hands on experience with malware hence I decided to create a Malware Analysis Lab and document the process.

In this page, I will be documenting the important steps I followed to setup a Malware Analysis Lab with [FlareVM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) and Remnux. Later on I will be analysing various malware and list out their fingerprints, behaviours, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) etc.

### **Topology**

Will be utilized during Dynamic Analysis.

### **Tools used for Analysis**

- VirusTotal - Analyze files and URLs for viruses, worms, trojan and other kinds of malicious content.
- Pestudio - Used to statically analyze executlable files for malicious artifacts
- Cutter - Advanced and open-source tool for reverse engineering malware.
- Procmon - Process Monitor is used for real-time monitoring of all file system acitivity.

### **Malware Analyzed**

- Zeus Banking Trojan
- PDF Malware

  **Overview of analysis**

  - Fingerprint of the malware
  - Static Analysis
  - Dynamic Analysis

# The Project

## Installation of Flare VM

To be able to create the laboratory it is important know the working of Oracle Virtualbox since that is our base and install Windows 10 Enterprise with atleast 75GB of allocated memory to avoid storage issues.

Domain join the Windows 10 machine and fill out the required fields.

Disable the Windows Defender Firewall on this machine, this step is required since this is the machine we will be installing Flare VM containing all the tools required to analyze the malware. Windows Defender will block Flare VM and the malware, as it should, if enabled. ( not recommended in the environment you work in or any other personal environment )

**Create a snapshot of the machine, to restore machine to this point if anything goes wrong when installing Flare VM or when running malware.**

Download the Flare VM installation file : https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm/blob/main/install.ps1 onto the Windows 10 VM.

Run PowerShell as administrator:

- Run: ```Unblock-File .\install.ps1``` to unblock the installer.
- Run: ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted```
- Run ```.\install.ps1```

Flare VM takes a few hours to install, it restarts plenty of times and finally starts with the Flare OS installed.

## Zeus Banking Trojan and analysis:

Zeus malware can give attackers full access to infected machines  or gain access to an infected computerâ€™s banking credentials and other financial information, many forms of the Zeus virus can also be used to add CryptoLocker ransomware to an operating system or add infected computers to a botnet to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

### [Downloading Zeus Banking Trojan (Exercise caution)](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/tree/master/malware/Binaries/ZeusBankingVersion_26Nov2013)

## Fingerprint and properties of Zeus Malware:

- The trojan is labelled as **"invoice"** as a form of social engineering to trick people into clicking on it.
- The trojan also has the extension *".pdf"* to make it believable but is followed by *".exe"* which indicates that it is a executable which is the *first indicator of malware*

#### **VirusTotal Fingerprint Analysis:**

<img src="https://github.com/PaviKotees/Malware-Analysis/assets/154454339/c4e8e454-f31e-4b18-b79d-933eaf25bea9" height="48%" width="48%"/> <img src="https://github.com/PaviKotees/Malware-Analysis/assets/154454339/f2725462-7d11-41ff-b72a-b84697c78c31" height="48%" width="48%"/>

- Uploading the file to VirusTotal and the application identifies this file has been flagged by 64 vendors as malicious.
- VirusTotal also provides the various hashes of the file which can used as identification of the file across various vendors and platforms.

#### **Pestudio Fingerprint Analysis:**

- The **SHA256** hash value is the same when analyzed using VirusTotal and Pestudio.
- Pestudio labels executables with *M Z* tag on the first-bytes > text hence proving that it is not a pdf file.

## Static Analysis of Zeus Malware

<img src="https://github.com/PaviKotees/Malware-Analysis/assets/154454339/3e14cfc7-bcc6-49f0-803d-6c152b05c7fd" height="48%" width="48%"/>

- The raw-size and virtual-size of the Zeus Malware is similar indicating that it is not a packed executable file. A packed executable has a core payload surrounded by arbitary code in order to change the size of the file which is a method used to confuse the antivirus software.

<img src="https://github.com/PaviKotees/Malware-Analysis/assets/154454339/d387d11a-55a6-43fa-9c61-31977cc5526b" height="48%" width="48%"/> <img src="https://github.com/PaviKotees/Malware-Analysis/assets/154454339/c23c9d3e-6e98-47a2-a8c7-3af89da2a21f" height="48%" width="48%"/>

- Pestudio identifies strings and flags it as malicious. *KERNEL32.CreateFile* is a API call which indicates control over the kernel. These types of strings are buried in between arbitrary strings, which might be used to hiding the strings.
- [*KERNEL32.CreateFile*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) - Creates or opens a file or I/O device.
